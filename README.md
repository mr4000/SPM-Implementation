# SPM-Implementation
🧩 SPM Algorithm Hardware Implementation (Vivado)
This repository contains an FPGA-based implementation of the SPM algorithm as proposed in the paper  
**[“A Lightweight and Efficient Encryption/Decryption Coprocessor for RLWE-Based Cryptography”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659211)**  
published by IEEE. The design is developed, synthesized, and implemented using Xilinx Vivado, targeting post-implementation timing and resource analysis.
