# SPM-Implementation

🧩 **SPM Algorithm Hardware Implementation (Vivado)**  
This repository contains an FPGA-based implementation of the SPM algorithm as proposed in the paper  
**[“A Lightweight and Efficient Encryption/Decryption Coprocessor for RLWE-Based Cryptography”](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10659211)**  
published by IEEE. The design is developed, synthesized, and implemented using Xilinx Vivado, targeting post-implementation timing and resource analysis.

## 🧮 Polynomials Used (n = 8)

\[
A(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 + 6x^5 + 7x^6 + 8x^7
\]

\[
B(x) = 1 + 2x + 3x^2 + 4x^3 + 5x^4 + 6x^5 + 7x^6 + 8x^7
\]
